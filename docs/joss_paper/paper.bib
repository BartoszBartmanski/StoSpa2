	abstract = {Simulation of biomolecular networks is now indispensable for studying biological systems, from small reaction networks to large ensembles of cells. Here we present a novel approach for stochastic simulation of networks embedded in the dynamic environment of the cell and its surroundings. We thus sample trajectories of the stochastic process described by the chemical master equation with time-varying propensities. A comparative analysis shows that existing approaches can either fail dramatically, or else can impose impractical computational burdens due to numerical integration of reaction propensities, especially when cell ensembles are studied. Here we introduce the Extrande method which, given a simulated time course of dynamic network inputs, provides a conditionally exact and several orders-of-magnitude faster simulation solution. The new approach makes it feasible to demonstrate, using decision-making by a large population of quorum sensing bacteria, that robustness to fluctuations from upstream signaling places strong constraints on the design of networks determining cell fate. Our approach has the potential to significantly advance both understanding of molecular systems biology and design of synthetic circuits.},

@article{Hellander2017,
	Abstract = {The reaction-diffusion master equation is a stochastic model often utilized in the study of biochemical reaction networks in living cells. It is applied when the spatial distribution of molecules is important to the dynamics of the system. A viable approach to resolve the complex geometry of cells accurately is to discretize space with an unstructured mesh. Diffusion is modeled as discrete jumps between nodes on the mesh, and the diffusion jump rates can be obtained through a discretization of the diffusion equation on the mesh. Reactions can occur when molecules occupy the same voxel. In this paper, we develop a method for computing accurate reaction rates between molecules occupying the same voxel in an unstructured mesh. For large voxels, these rates are known to be well approximated by the reaction rates derived by Collins and Kimball, but as the mesh is refined, no analytical expression for the rates exists. We reduce the problem of computing accurate reaction rates to a pure preprocessing step, depending only on the mesh and not on the model parameters, and we devise an efficient numerical scheme to estimate them to high accuracy. We show in several numerical examples that as we refine the mesh, the results obtained with the reaction-diffusion master equation approach those of a more fine-grained Smoluchowski particle-tracking model.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we present an overview of agent-based models that are used to simulate mechanical and physiological phenomena in cells and tissues, and we discuss underlying concepts, limitations, and future perspectives of these models. As the interest in cell and tissue mechanics increase, agent-based models are becoming more common the modeling community. We overview the physical aspects, complexity, shortcomings, and capabilities of the major agent-based model categories: lattice-based models (cellular automata, lattice gas cellular automata, cellular Potts mod-els), off-lattice models (center-based models, deformable cell models, vertex models), and hybrid discrete-continuum models. In this way, we hope to assist future researchers in choosing a model for the phenomenon they want to model and understand. The article also contains some novel results.},

@article{Isaacson2013,
	Abstract = {The reaction-diffusion master equation (RDME) is a lattice stochastic reaction-diffusion model that has been used to study spatially distributed cellular processes. The RDME is often interpreted as an approximation to spatially-continuous models in which molecules move by Brownian motion and react by one of several mechanisms when sufficiently close. In the limit that the lattice spacing approaches zero, in two or more dimensions, the RDME has been shown to lose bimolecular reactions. The RDME is therefore not a convergent approximation to any spatially-continuous model that incorporates bimolecular reactions. In this work we derive a new convergent RDME (CRDME) by finite volume discretization of a spatially-continuous stochastic reaction-diffusion model popularized by Doi. We demonstrate the numerical convergence of reaction time statistics associated with the CRDME. For sufficiently large lattice spacings or slow bimolecular reaction rates, we also show the reaction time statistics of the CRDME may be approximated by those from the RDME. The original RDME may therefore be interpreted as an approximation to the CRDME in several asymptotic limits.},
